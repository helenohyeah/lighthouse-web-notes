# Day 2 Lecture
Instructor: Travis Borsa

## Program Curriculum
Main components of the program and be assessed on (in terms of learning progress)
* completion of assignments and tutorials
* code reviews (take the initiative to request them)
* tech interviews
* project evaluations (solo and group)
* quiz answers
* test answers
* assisstances

## Notes
* break problem down into psuedo code
* ask: what are the basic steps that my program has to do?
  * aim for smallest possible executable program
  * makes it easier to understand and debug
* write, debug and refactor each step
* aim to run code (or logic) the minimum possible. I.e. if a function is run multiple times, store the result into a variable and use that variable instead of re-running the function.

## Concepts to look into
* node debugger
